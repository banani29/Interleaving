âœ¨ What is Interleaving ?

Interleaving is a technique used to compare ranking systems by blending their outputs into a single ranked list shown to the same user. Unlike A/B testingâ€”which splits users into separate groupsâ€”interleaving evaluates multiple rank systems simultaneously by observing which rank systemâ€™s items receive more user clicks. This allows for real-time, preference-based comparisons and faster insights into which ranking method performs better.
